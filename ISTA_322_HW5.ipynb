        " \n",
        "The original dataset contains 100k district court decisions, although I've downsampled it to only 1000 rows to make the uploads faster.  Each row contains info about a judge, their demographics, party affiliation, etc.  Rows also contain information about the case they were deciding on.  Was it a criminal or civil case?  What year was it?  Was the direction of the decision liberal or conservative?  \n",
        " \n",
        "While the current denormalized format is fine for analysis, it's not fine for a database as it violates many normalization rules. Your goal is to normalize it by designing a simple schema, then wrangling it into the proper dataframes, then pushing it all to AWS.  \n",
        " \n",
        "For the first part of this assignment you should wind up with three tables.  One with case information, one with judge information, one that has casetype information, and the last with case category information.  Each table should be reduced so that there are not then repeating rows, and primary keys should be assigned within each.  These tables should be called 'cases', 'judges', and 'casetype'.\n",
        " \n",
        "For the last part you should make a rollup table that calculates the percent of liberal decisions for each party level and each case category.  This will allow for one to get a quick look at how the political party affiliation of judges impacts the direction of a decision for different case categories (e.g. criminal, civil, labor). "
