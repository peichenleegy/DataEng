## Course Description:
### This course will be inviting for a wide variety of students from across disciplines, and they will learn how to use industry standard tools and practices to make large data sets usable for scientists and other decision makers. From data collection and preparation, to the creation of big data stores, databases, or systems to make data flow, this course will focus on the practical work needed to prepare big data for analyses across contexts. Students will be introduced to a variety of technical tools for data management, storage, use, and manipulation.

## Course Objectives: 
### The objective of this course is to train students in the tools and theory behind data engineering so that they can be deployed in the real world. This will revolve around extracting data from static and streaming sources, learning how to transform it in a way to be used for later analytics/machine learning, and data science applications, storing and querying that data in a database. Additional emphasis will be placed on learning some cloud computing methods.

## Expected Learning Outcomes
###
1. Students will be able to extract data from static and streaming data sources
2. Students will develop and apply skills for data cleaning, munging, and transformation so that they are usable for
later analysis.
3. Students will be able to generate and query SQL databases and access said databases from a Python interface
4. Students will understand major cloud and distributed computing technologies and be able to leverage them for data
engineering application.

## Required Readings:
We’ll be using the book Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems​ ​by Martin Kleppmann. This will be coupled with other free online resources

## Grade Distribution:
###
90-100% = A “exemplary, far beyond reqs/expectations” 
80-89% = B “exceeds requirements/expectations”
70-79%= C “meets requirements/expectations”
60-69% = D “falls short of requirements/expectations” 
< 60%= E “repeat of course needed”
